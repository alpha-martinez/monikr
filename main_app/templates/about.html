            because we believe that art shouldn’t be limited for the most part, content on this app may be explicit.
            there is not a nswf tag, but there is a tw tag.</p>
        <h3>artists -</h3>
            <p>artist must submit a portfolio of at least 3 quality examples of their work
            work will be the major factor in application approval
            judgement of work is not harsh
            checking that work isn’t racist or overtly offensive without a subjectively good enough reason
            checking that the work of is of a minimum level of skill and quality
            experience is not needed but talent will be judged just to the slightest to maintain a (achievable) standard
                may submit application again in 1 month with new work submitted
            artist must submit a moniker
            this will be approved based on availability
            artist must send a link to some sort of site or press
            work that is deemed offensive without a subjectively good enough reason is reason for rejection of application
                this could be an ig or twitter, just something to show intent</p>
        <h3>salon -</h3>
            <p>artist have control over their specific salons
            they may become or appoint a moderator and create rules
            they may ask us to handle moderator
            we will give them a survey on how they would like their salon run and that will dictate their specific content policy
             but we reserve the right to remove anything we find offensive without a subjectively good enough reason</p>
        <h3>gallery -</h3>
            <p>content posted should be original work only
            credit should be given to correct people
